It will come as little surprise to my European friends and others that my education regarding the Great War was woefully inadequate. Yes, we learned of the tragedy that befell Austria’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand. We were instructed to repeat ad nausea, "Entangling alliances." (The same tactic was used to successfully educate us about John D. Rockefeller -- "Standard Oil!")

This narrative of the summer of 1914 impressed an inescapable reality upon us: war could not be avoided. The Guns of August did not fire shots because they were ordered to do so by men, but because they must. The web of alliances was a simple domino effect that was not only inescapable, but inevitable. Thus, 17 million people died.

Similar readings of history and our present global predicament are not simply a statement of fact, but one of absolution. "This is how the world works." Israelis will fight Palestinians. The Middle East will remain a fundamentalist powder keg. Russia’s love for strongmen will keep them perpetually on the brink of war. Africa will be poor.

The great and frightening news is that this is complete and utter bullshit.

In Belgium at the centennial of the launch of the "War to end all wars," I surrendered to my inner-nerd and immersed myself in Barbara Tuchman’s masterpiece, [*The Guns of August*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11366.The_Guns_of_August)*.*

Though, I’d like to pretend her work has sat on my shelf awaiting a moment of peace to delve into war, my only real exposure to the book was a passing reference in the film *Thirteen Days*, Kevin Costner’s account of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Frustrated with the grisly generals, desperate for war, Kennedy invokes the books warning against preparing for and fighting "the last war," rather than the present conflict. Tuchman’s Pulitzer Prize winning account of the build to war and resulting carnage certainly reinforces that point. However, the strong argument from the opening pages is not a warning about poorly prosecuting war, but creating it.

Tuchman’s page-turner is a witty, rapid-fire account of the persistence of men to make war and drag their neighbors along. War instigated by Germany was strangely on the horizon since 1870. The first decade of the 20th Century was spent preparing for this war. Nobody is quite sure why.

The frantic days following Archduke Ferdinand’s assassination by Serbian Nationalists were not characterized by executing pre-existing orders. They were actually days filled with plans being delayed. The German Commander in Chief, Moltke, wrote that he was "Heartbroken" by delays to his plan. When the Kaiser suggested the German war machine turn from the Western front and focus only on Russia, Moltkey responded:

Your Majesty, it cannot be done. The deployment of millions cannot be improvised. If Your Majesty insists on leading the whole army to the East it will not be an army ready for battle but a disorganized mob of armed men with no arrangements for supply. Those arrangements took a whole year of intricate labor to complete…and once settled it cannot be altered.

Think about that. Why did Germany *have* to invade France? It had been "settled." The plans were in motion. They would have been difficult to change having taken a whole year to create. In case the foolishness of this approach is lost on the reader, Tuchman adds her own commentary on Moltke’s line, "And once settled it cannot be altered." She writes:

…that rigid phrase, the basis for every German mistake, the phrase that launched the invasion of Belgium and the submarine war against the United States, the inevitable phrase when military plans dictate policy.

I primarily think about and work in the space of social change. So why am writing about WWI other than to exercise my love of history? There are two reasons beyond the cliche’ that "Those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it."

The first is that narrative matters. We were told by the *Hope and Change* campaign that all that mattered was moving forward. The problem is that policy is made based on the dominate narrative of history. Our domestic and foreign 9/11 response is drastically different if we believe that the attack was a failure of people, not policy. We simply change the people rather than the whole policy. Similarly, our response is different if we believe a robust law enforcement response (likely true) could have prevented the day rather than only a large military offensive.

We allow a false narrative to become conventional wisdom at our peril. All decisions and justifications for those decisions flow from that narrative, and if it is wrong -- poor decisions will follow.

Second, nothing is inevitable. The first several chapters of *The Guns of August* invite the reader into state dinners and bedrooms across Europe where at all hours diplomats are entreating leaders to fight. Generals are educating politicians on the necessity of expedient war.

Russian diplomats were so forceful in interrupting sleep to implore French leaders to enter the war in the first days that the French Premier remarked, "These Russians are even worse insomniacs than they are drinkers."

The Germans for their part vigorously debated the need to even declare war on Russia. Couldn’t they just remain defensive they wondered.

That war, and no war since simply sprang from "Entangling alliances." It was a choice that men made, not a fait accomplis. At any number of moments, men could have chosen a different path and altered not just the course of the Great War, but all wars to follow.

The wrong choices were made. War happened and led to a century of death on a scale never before comprehended. That they were choices gives us agency. Agency and responsibility.

From drug policy, to our archaic voting system to climate change -- we must remember that nothing is inevitable, unless good people remain silent.
